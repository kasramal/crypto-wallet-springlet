1. Change Coin Enum.
1.1. Add coin (name, iso, icon, ...) to Coin enum.
1.2. Add Api Providers supporting the coin.
1.3. Update convertValue method so that your coin values would be converted properly.
1.4. Add coin name (fa and en) to messages.properties
1.5. If the coin is a second layer remember to update getBaseCoin and secondLayerValues methods.

2. Implement an AddressGenerator for your coin.
2.1. Update AddressGeneratorFactory to return an AddressGenerator dedicated to your coin.
2.2. If you are going to add a bitcoin-like coin supporting p2pkh follow the steps bellow
2.2.1. Find version byte and wif prefix for your coin; this document would be handful: https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/wiki/Altcoin-Version-Mappings#bip44-altcoin-version-mapping-table
2.2.2. Add your coin spec to LegacyAddressVariant enum
2.2.3. Extend LegacyAddressGenerator and set the variant variable to LegacyAddressVariant value that you have defined previously.

3. Implement EstimatedFee interface for your coin
3.1. Update getFee method of FeeUtils in order to instantiate a <Coin>Fee as expected.

4. Implement a <Coin>Transaction and <Coin>TransactionBuilder for yourself.
4.1. If are going to add a bitcoin-like coin or a fork of that you can follow these steps:
4.1.1. Extend GenericForkTransaction for fork coins such as BitcoinCash.
4.1.2. Extend GenericTransaction for bitcoin-like coins such as Litecoin.
4.1.3. Override convertValue method of your extended class.
4.2. Remember to write a CoinUtils so that the entire project would remain stylish.
4.3. Write a <Coin>TransactionValidator to validate transaction constraints.
4.4. Add a case <Coin>: to the factory method of GenericTransactionBuilder.
4.5. Add your CoinTransactionValidator to TransactionValidator module
4.6. Note that jumping any of these steps would be the reason of throwing an Coin_NOT_SUPPORTED Exception while pushing a transaction.

5. Update any Api Provider listed in step 1.2. for the coin
5.1. Implement <ApiProvider><Coin>Helper according to API Documentations
5.1.1. You can extend ApiProviderGenericHelper for bitcoin-like coins and forks of bitcoin

6. Push your transaction and enjoy the taste of your coffee! :)
