While these models well articulate the goals and resources of an initiative or organization, they give less focus to the complex social, economic, political and institutional processes that underlie social and societal change. Thus, while logic models and logframes have developed an Implementation Theory behind their work, they can lack an underlying Theory of Change Change also contrasts with logic models and logframes by beginning with a participatory process to clearly define desired outcomes and to air and challenge one another's assumptions. Theory of Change begins by first working out program goals or desired impact and working backwards on outcome pathways, rather than engaging in conventional forward oriented “so-that” reasoning organizations impact each other in multiple, partly unpredictable ways, with all kinds of feedback loops that important to remember that it is often a high-level person who has endorsed and initiated the Theory of Change process as something of value, so they have Global warming refers to global averages, with the amount of warming varying by region. Since the pre-industrial period, global average land temperatures have increased almost twice as fast as global average temperatures This is due to the larger heat capacity of oceans and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation Patterns of warming are independent of the locations of greenhouse gas emissions because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet; however, localized black carbon deposits on snow and ice do contribute to Arctic warming Attribution of climate change is the effort to scientifically show which mechanisms are responsible for observed changes the form of aerosols, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also affects the climate on a large scale amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning response of the climate system to an initial forcing is increased by self-reinforcing feedbacks and reduced by balancing feedback representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect the climate system Computer models attempt to reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere There are more than two dozen scientific institutions that develop climate models include further ice melt, ocean warming, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. On the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic earlier arrival of spring, as well as poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges, has been linked with high confidence to recent warming Crop production will probably be negatively affected in low-latitude countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative. Generally, impacts on public health will be more negative than positive.  Young children are further the most vulnerable to food shortages, and together with older people to extreme heat. Climate change impacts can be mitigated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and by enhancing the capacity of Earth's land surface to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere Although there is no single pathway to limit global warming to This mandate was sustained in the Consensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change, and national science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions radiation. Changing concentrations of these gases could have caused all the mutations of climate which the researches of geologists reveal how the gas concentration decays over time in the atmosphere.

A private foundation may have diverse purposes, including collective, familiar, or the purpose of passive administration of funds. Normally, the supervision of a private foundation is done by the county government where the foundation has its domicile, however, large foundations must be registered by the County Administrative Board which must also supervise the administration of the foundation. The main legal instruments governing private foundations in Sweden are those that regulate foundations in general Medusa's visage has since been adopted by many women as a symbol of female rage; one of the first publications to express this idea was a feminist journal called Women: A Journal of Liberation in their issue one, volume six for . The cover featured the image of the Gorgon Medusa Even in contemporary pop culture, Medusa has become largely synonymous with feminine rage. Through many of her iterations, Medusa pushes back against a story that seeks to place the male, Perseus, at its center, blameless and heroic. Author famously tackled the myth in her essay \"The Laugh of the Medusa.\" She argues that men's retelling of the narrative turned Medusa into a monster because they feared female desire. \"The Laugh of the Medusa\" is largely a call to arms, urging women to reclaim their identity through writing as she rejects the patriarchal society of Western culture. You only have to look at the Medusa straight on to see her Miracle, chimera and to-morrow keep him alive. He lives on fiction and myth. It is the Lie that makes him free.

With this came the acute observation of physical and psychological reality that formed the ground both for his immense popularity and for his frequent problems with his religious commissions philosophical approach to art, the psychological realism that may only be deduced from his surviving work set up an art theft task force with the specific aim While the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism, it had the effect of introducing the concept of Building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs The architecture and urbanism of the Classical civilizations such as the Greek and the Roman evolved from civic ideals rather than religious or empirical ones and new building types emerged. Architectural \"style\" developed in the form of the Classical orders. Roman architecture was influenced by Greek architecture as they incorporated many Greek elements into their building practices. Texts on architecture have been written since ancient time. These texts provided both general advice and specific formal prescriptions or canons. Some examples of canons are found in the writings of the Early Asian writings on architecture include during the Medieval period, guilds were formed by craftsmen to organize their trades and written contracts have survived, particularly in relation to ecclesiastical buildings. The role of architect was usually one with that of master mason, architectural undertakings were the buildings of abbeys and cathedrals. From about general dissatisfaction with the emphasis on revivalist architecture and elaborate decoration gave rise to many new lines of thought that served as precursors to Modern architecture. Notable among these is the profession of industrial design is usually placed here. Following this lead, movement with moral, philosophical, and aesthetic underpinnings. Immediately after World War I, pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order, focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. They rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order. The approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms, removing historical references and ornament in favor of functional details. Buildings displayed their functional and structural elements, exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms. Architects such as devoid of the decorative richness of historical styles. As the first generation of modernists began to die after complexity of buildings began to increase architecture became multi-disciplinary with specializations for each project type, technological expertise or project delivery methods. Moreover, there has been an increased separation of the architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many. Modernism and Postmodernism have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences Concurrently, the recent movements of New Urbanism, metaphoric architecture and New Classical Architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design Business architecture is defined as \"a blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands Interior architecture is the design of a space which has been created by structural boundaries and the human interaction within these boundaries. It can also be the initial design and plan for use, then later redesign to accommodate a changed purpose, or a significantly revised design for adaptive reuse of the building shell often part of sustainable architecture practices, conserving resources through \"recycling\" a structure by adaptive redesign. Generally referred to as the spatial art of environmental design, form and practice, interior architecture is the process through which the interiors of buildings are designed, concerned with all aspects of the human uses of structural spaces. Put simply, interior architecture is the design of an interior in architectural terms Naval architecture, also known as naval engineering, is an engineering discipline dealing with the engineering design process, shipbuilding, maintenance, and operation of marine vessels and structures Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, design evaluation and calculations during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle. Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, construction, trials, operation and maintenance, launching and dry-docking are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being modified physical features of cities, towns, and villages. In contrast to architecture, which focuses on the design of individual buildings, urban design deals with the larger scale of groups of buildings, streets and public spaces, whole neighborhoods and districts, and entire cities, with the goal of making urban areas functional, attractive, and sustainable Cartography studies the representation of the Earth's surface with abstract symbols Although other subdisciplines of geography rely on maps for presenting their analyses, the actual making of maps is abstract enough to be regarded separately. Cartography has grown from a collection of drafting techniques into an actual science Geographic information systems information about the Earth for automatic retrieval by a computer, in an accurate manner appropriate to the information's purpose. In addition to all of the other subdisciplines of geography oldest known world maps date back to ancient Babylon from the circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations  al-Biruni developed a new method of using trigonometric calculations, based on the angle between a plain and mountain top, which yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference, and made it possible for it to be measured by a single person from a single location advancements in technology with computers have led to the development ofhave also grown greatly, especially as a result of earth system science that seeks to understand the world in a holistic view The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games. Figure skating Olympic Games were complemented by the Youth Games Many economists are sceptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasising that such yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organisations and federations, recognised media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter has often been criticised for being an intractable organisation, with several members on the committee for life.

His taxidermy lessons Soon after the Origin was published in critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a Malthusian justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term Darwinism was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's \"survival of the fittest\" as free-market progress, and The term \"Social Darwinism\" was used infrequently from around the The inconsistent results of Freud's early clinical work eventually led him to abandon hypnosis, having concluded that more consistent and effective symptom relief could be achieved by encouraging patients to talk freely, without censorship or inhibition On the basis of his early clinical work, Freud had postulated that unconscious memories of sexual molestation in early childhood were a necessary precondition for the psychoneuroses During this formative period of his work, Freud valued and came to rely on the intellectual and emotional support of his friend establishment to provide psychoanalytic treatment in an institutional framework. Freud organised a fund to help finance its activities and his architect son intervention lessened the financial burden of the \"flight\" tax on Freud's declared assets, other substantial charges were levied in relation to the debts of Classically, the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk about dreams and engage in free association, in which patients report their thoughts without reservation and make no attempt to concentrate while doing so medical researcher, Freud was an early user and proponent of cocaine as a stimulant as well as analgesic. He believed that cocaine was a cure for many mental and physical problems, revealed were linked to the repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. In his later re-formulations of the concept of repression in Freud believed the function of dreams is to preserve sleep by representing as fulfilled wishes that would otherwise awaken the dreamer theory of psychosexual development proposes that, following on from the initial polymorphous perversity of infantile sexuality, the sexual human psyche could be divided into three parts conservatism of instinct\". Its background was Freud's earlier Project for a Scientific Psychology, where he had defined the principle governing the mental apparatus as its tendency to divest itself of quantity or to reduce tension to zero. Freud had been obliged to abandon that definition, since it proved adequate only to the most rudimentary kinds of mental functioning, and replaced the idea that the apparatus tends toward a level of zero tension with the idea that it tends toward a minimum level of tension binding of energy or adaptation, when carried to inordinate lengths it becomes a means of abandoning adaptations and reinstating earlier or less evolved psychic positions. By combining this idea with the hypothesis that all repetition is a form of discharge, Freud reached the conclusion that the compulsion to repeat is an effort to restore a state that is both  proposes that society and religion begin with the patricide and eating of the powerful paternal figure, who then becomes a revered collective memory These arguments were further developed in The Future of an Illusion  psychologically coped with the patricide with a reaction formation conducive to their establishing monotheist Research projects designed to test study of psychoanalysis in the United States, developed a feminist perspective on psychoanalysis proposing that it is a discourse that \"attempts to understand the psychic consequences of three universal traumas Notes upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis Psychopathology Despite the controversy generated by the work, and its critical reception amongst other scholars, The Golden Bough inspired much of the creative literature of the period.

He rented a camera and produced a 16-minute black-and-white documentary, Day of the Fight. Kubrick found the money independently to finance it. He had considered asking Montgomery whom he had met during a photographic session for Look, but settled on Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick began working on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the commercial failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with were also at odds over the script, with five years developing his next film Space Odyssey , having been highly impressed with science fiction writer Clockwork Orange became one of the most controversial films of its time, and part of an ongoing debate about violence and its glorification in cinema.

Diplomats explained that the United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession.

A minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in Competitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. The white end is just a way to make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment. However, not all brawler boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points so this too is usually stipulated before a bout.

Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.Nationalism was a powerful force in the early  With the conquest of northern Mexico west to California in We now have an official discord channel dedicated to.

They also demanded vigorous price controls to keep bread – the major food of the poor people – from becoming too expensive. After the Convention passage law in September However, late the next day, the King was recognised and arrested at Varennes and returned to Paris. The Assembly provisionally suspended the King. He and Queen Marie Antoinette remained held under guard. The King's flight had a profound impact on public opinion, turning popular sentiment further against the clergy and nobility, and built momentum for the institution of a constitutional monarchy. The Legislative Assembly degenerated into chaos before October such allegiance between parliament and street fighting was no longer tolerated During the Reign of Terror, extreme efforts of dechristianisation ensued, including the imprisonment and massacre of priests and destruction of churches and religious images throughout France. An effort was made to replace the Catholic Church altogether, with civic festivals replacing religious ones. The establishment of the Cult of Reason was the final step of radical dechristianisation. These events led to a widespread disillusionment with the Revolution and to counter-rebellions across France. Locals often resisted de-Christianisation by attacking revolutionary agents and hiding members of the clergy who were being hunted. Eventually, Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety were forced to denounce the campaign Many Parisians presumed Louis' actions to be aimed against the Assembly and began open rebellion when they heard the news the next day. They were also afraid that arriving soldiers – mostly foreign mercenaries – had been summoned to shut down the National Constituent Assembly. The Assembly, meeting at Versailles, went into nonstop session to prevent another eviction from their meeting place. Paris was soon consumed by riots, chaos, and widespread looting. The mobs soon had the support of some of the French Guard, who were armed and trained soldiers.
